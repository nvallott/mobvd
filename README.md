## Abstract of thesis

In collaboration with the Direction générale de la mobilité et des routes de l'État de Vaud (DGMR), accessibility issues are analysed and discussed. Depending on the selected strategy, the articulation of objectives makes it possible to develop a new intermediate tool to meet these demands. The division and delimitation of the territory of Vaud, as well as the creation of travel time data between these different spatial entities, are integrated through two types of isochron visualizations, and merged into a geovisualization application. Feedback from potential users evaluates the interface's possibilities to assess the accessibility throughout the canton with a decision-making aid perspective.
